          A learning mindset with an unbreakable consistency will break the
          walls put forward by the world before them. Our mothers make us eat
          while showing the brightness of the moon in the silent dark, and now I
          proclaim that if we see the brightness in ourselves we can fill the
          world with a louder brightness. I see and think about the stars every
          time. when I get depressed because we can learn one thing by seeing
          them every time, they glow in the dark. I am a fellow who is
          interested in seeking the mysteries of the objects in the deepest and
          the darkest playgrounds. I got in love with computers in 3rd grade
          when my family bought the first desktop pc in my home. I was just
          astonished to see the fast-moving pages on the pc. I thought of them
          as a book that had several pages and they move fast. And when I grew
          up, I got to understand the magicians behind this magic, “The
          programmers”. As soon as I got to know about the profession I was
          eager to make myself into it. At present, I am doing my Bachelor’s in
          computer science and engineering from a reputed institution. The love
          that I have for computers, and the beautiful dark space above me make
          me unsleepable and push me to find the real passion that I have.
